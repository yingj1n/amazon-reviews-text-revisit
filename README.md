Sentiment Analysis &amp; Topic Modeling on Amazon Product Reviews

The repo revisits an old sentiment analysis project to investigate further using topic modeling. This project was initially done with a group in an effort to understand what invokes users' response to leave a helpful or not-helpful feedback. Report, slides, and code of the original project can be found here: https://github.com/anujs3/amazon-reviews.
